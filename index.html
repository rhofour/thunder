<p>Our goal for this project is to implement factor analysis in the distributed machine learning framework Thunder.</p>

<h2>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h2>

<p>Modern data analysis (especially of neural data) often involves data with 100+ dimensions which are difficult to analyze as-is. To makes sense of this high dimensional data we often assume it comes from a much lower dimensional data. To find this lower dimensional data we perform one of several dimensionality reduction algorithms such as Factor Analysis.</p>

<p>There are already several tools available for performing factor analysis, however we're unaware of any which scale well when the data we're interested in doesn't fit in memory on a single machine. However, with newer methods of data collection such as optogenetic methods we're easily able to collect datasets on the order of 100GB-1TB.</p>

<p>Thunder is a data analysis framework built on top of Apache Spark designed for working with these kinds of datasets. The idea behind using Thunder is that if we can keep the data we're interested in distributed across the main memory of several machines and avoid reading and writing to disk then we can perform analyses much in much less time.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h2>

<p>While we believe using multiple machines to keep our data in memory will offer a substantial speed up to this algorithm, it will also significantly increases the communication costs we have.</p>

<p>Another challenge we will face is in how to split this workload up among multiple machines. As far as we're aware there is no trivial way to divide the work when building a factor analysis model so we may have to devise several different ways to do this and figure out which works best.</p>

<h2>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h2>

<p>Since our algorithm is being implemented inside of Thunder we definitely intend to take advantage of any Thunder or Spark primitives and functions which make our job easier.</p>

<p>Ideally we hope to test our algorithm with real neural data from Prof. Byron Yu. However, if we're unable to get real data to test with we can easily generate synthetic data instead since factor analysis is a generative model.</p>

<p>We have few requirements for the machines we test on so long as they can communicate reasonably quickly with each other and are able to read in our large dataset.</p>

<h2>
<a id="goals-and-deliverables" class="anchor" href="#goals-and-deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals and Deliverables</h2>

<h3>
<a id="plan-to-achieve" class="anchor" href="#plan-to-achieve" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plan to Achieve</h3>

<p>An implementation of factor analysis in Thunder which is able to outperform an optimized implementation on a single machine when the data being analyzed doesn't fit in memory. We suspect any reasonably efficient implementation that keeps all of the data in memory will be able to achieve this because of the major increase in latency when reading from disk.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hope-to-achieve" class="anchor" href="#hope-to-achieve" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hope to Achieve</h3>

<p>Ideally we would like to see increasing speedup as we add more machines. This may be difficult to achieve as it requires additional communication, however it is conceivably that to a certain point adding additional machines could improve performance if all of them are able to do significant work.</p>

<h2>
<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h2>

<p>As discussed in Resources we can implement this on either EC2, Latedays, or some other cluster.</p>

<p>Building our algorithm on top of Thunder is a reasonable choice because Thunder was specifically made for efficiently running neural data analysis algorithms like Factor Analysis.</p>
