Lots of frameworks built on top of Spark provide distributed matrices and a few operations, but it appears that none of them offer a matrix inverse which can be very useful. This is likely a sign that it is a very difficult operation to implement and we probably should have paid more attention to this.\r\n\r\n## The Challenge\r\nMatrix inverse does not distribute easily and computing any part of it generally requires access to many parts of the original matrix. This communication makes its implementation difficult when working with distributed matrices. It also does not lend itself well to Spark primitives.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\nWe will test on Amazon EC2 because it is easy to deploy Thunder there and it allows us to easily test on many different cluster configurations.\r\n\r\n## Goals and Deliverables\r\n### Plan to Achieve\r\nA correct implementation of distributed matrix inverse which is faster than using a single machine (which would be forced to read and write from disk).\r\n\r\n### Hope to Achieve\r\nIdeally we would like to be competitive with the implementation provided by the paper we our working from.\r\n\r\n## Platform Choice\r\nAs discussed in Resources we will use Amazon EC2.\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\nApril  25\r\n* Have a correct implementation\r\n\r\nMay 2\r\n* Successfully deploy our implementation and the reference implementation to EC2\r\n* Develop a set of tests and collect data\r\n* Graph our running time vs. the reference running time\r\n\r\nMay 6\r\n* Develop hypotheses as to where bottlenecks are and how we can reduce/eliminate them\r\n\r\nMay 9\r\n* Implement some improvements and record the change in running time on our test cases\r\n\r\n## Progress Report\r\nOur progress report is available [here](https://github.com/rhofour/thunder/wiki/Project-Checkpoint)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
