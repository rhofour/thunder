class BlockMethod(SourceExtractionMethod):
    """
    Extract sources from spatiotemporal data by independently processing blocks.

    A block method extracts sources by applying a function to each block to recover
    sources, and then merging sources across blocks. It requires two components:
    an algorithm (which extracts sources from a single block) and
    a merger (which combines sources across blocks)

    Parameters
    ----------
    algorithm : BlockAlgorithm
        Which algorithm to use

    merger : BlockMerger, optional, default = BasicBlockMerger
        Which merger to use

    kwargs : dict
        Any extra arguments to be passed to the algorithm or merger,
        useful for providing options to these components
